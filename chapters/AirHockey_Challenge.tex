This chapter describes the Robot Air Hockey completition that took place from 20 February 2023 to 1 November 2023.
It covers the game rules, the motivation behind the event, the various stages of the competition and the outcomes achieved.

\subsection{Air Hockey Game}
Air Hockey is a zero sum game in which two opponents compete interacting with a puck on a table and trying to score a goal
sending the puck into the opponent's goal while at the same time preventing the opponent from scoring.
The table is rectangular and smooth, with low-friction achieved by air blown from under the surface, designed to mimic the surface of ice.
This game is dynamic and the puck reaches high velocities that require the players to have quick reflexes and strategic positioning.

%For this competition the players are robotic manipulators

\subsection{Motivation}
This competition was organized to \textit{close the sim-to-real gap}, i.e., the differences and challenges that arise
when transferring a robotic system trained in a simulated environment to the real world.
In fact, when transferring the robotic system to the real world we have to deal with
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Disturbances}:
    Real-world environments are subject to various unpredictable disturbances, such as vibrations, 
    temperature variations, and other environmental factors that can affect the performance of the robotic system.
    \item \textbf{Observation noise}:
    Sensors used in real-world applications often introduce noise into the observed data, 
    which can lead to inaccuracies in the robot's perception of its environment and subsequent decision-making processes.
    \item \textbf{Safety}:
    Ensuring the safety of both the robotic system and its surroundings, including humans and other objects, is paramount. 
    The robot must operate within safe parameters to avoid causing harm or damage.
    \item \textbf{Model mismatch}:
    The physical properties and dynamics of real-world systems often differ from their simulated counterparts. 
    This mismatch can lead to discrepancies in performance and behavior when the robot is deployed outside the controlled environment of a simulation.
    \item \textbf{Delays}:
    Communication and processing delays can occur in real-world systems, affecting the timing and execution of the robot's actions. 
    These delays need to be accounted for to ensure smooth and accurate operation.
    \item \textbf{Actuator limitations}:
    The actuators used to control the robot have physical limitations in terms of speed, precision, and strength. 
    These constraints must be considered when designing control strategies and algorithms.
    % \item \textbf{Physical feasibility}
    \item \textbf{Limited real-world interaction}:
    In the real world, opportunities for interaction and experimentation are often limited due to cost, time, and safety concerns. 
    This restriction makes it challenging to gather sufficient data for training and refining the robotic system.
\end{itemize}

The Robot Air Hockey Challenge provides a platform for researchers in the field of robot learning to interact with each
other on a realistic robotic task. In this competition team had to design and build their air hockey agents, competing against
each other in different subtasks (in simulation) and finally in an entire game (both in simulation and in the real world).
