\label{ch:robot_air_hockey_challenge}
This chapter describes the Robot Air Hockey completition that took place from 20 February 2023 to 1 November 2023.
It covers the game rules, the motivation behind the event, the various stages of the competition and the outcomes achieved.
The following information is derived from the challenge's website, i.e., \url{https://air-hockey-challenge.robot-learning.net}.

\subsection{Air Hockey Game}
Air Hockey is a zero sum game in which two opponents compete interacting with a puck on a table and trying to score a goal
sending the puck into the opponent's goal while at the same time preventing the opponent from scoring.
The table is rectangular and smooth, with low-friction achieved by air blown from under the surface, designed to mimic the surface of ice.
This game is dynamic and the puck reaches high velocities that require the players to have quick reflexes and strategic positioning.

%For this competition the players are robotic manipulators

\subsection{Motivation}
This competition was organized to \textit{close the sim-to-real gap}, i.e., the differences and challenges that arise
when transferring a robotic system trained in a simulated environment to the real world.
In fact, when transferring the robotic system to the real world we have to deal with
\begin{itemize}
    \item disturbances
    \item observation noise
    \item safety
    \item model mismatch
    \item delays
    \item actuator limitations
    \item physical feasibility
    \item limited real-world interaction
\end{itemize}

The Robot Air Hockey Challenge provides a platform for researchers in the field of robot learning to interact with each
other on a realistic robotic task. In this competition team had to design and build their air hockey agents, competing against
each other in different subtasks (in simulation) and finally in an entire game (both in simulation and in the real world).
