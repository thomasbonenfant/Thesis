\section{Noise Filtering}
\label{sec:noise_filtering}

During the challenge our agents were evaluated on a remote simulator that was slightly different from the local environments we used.
In order to mimic a real-world scenario this remote simulator introduced disturbances that could create problems to our agents.

The noise on the puck observations and the loss of tracking were particularly problematic.
To solve this problem a  kalman filter \cite{kalman_filter} was used on the puck's position to filter the noise.
Additionally, the noisy observations of joint positions and velocities were ignored and the reference joint positions and velocities given to the underlying
controller at the previous step were used as observations instead.
